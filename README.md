# textbackup :construction:

**EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/habenamare/textbackup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/habenamare/textbackup)

**textbackup** is a simple command line tool to backup your directory structure in
text format, currently JSON (to be extended).

## Why backup in text format?

I think **textbackup** can be used as a better than nothing backing up tool, especially
if the size of the files you want to backup is very large. I think sometimes just
remembering how your files were layed out and which files were there can help you
recreate your lost data if it can't be recovered by any means.
