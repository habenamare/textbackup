# textbackup :construction:

**EARLY STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/habenamare/textbackup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/habenamare/textbackup)

**textbackup** is a simple command line tool to backup your directory structure in
text format, currently JSON (to be extended).

## Why backup in text format?

A text format backup can be seen as a better-than-nothing backing up tool, especially
if the size of the files you want to backup is very large. This is because sometimes
just remembering how your files were layed out can help you recreate your lost data,
if it can't be recovered by any means.
